/**
 * @hai3/flux - Complete Flux Dataflow Pattern
 *
 * This package provides the unified Flux dataflow pattern:
 * - Type-safe event bus for pub/sub communication
 * - Redux store with dynamic slice registration
 * - Effect system types for event-driven state updates
 * - Module augmentation support for custom events and state
 *
 * SDK Layer: L1 (Only peer dependency on @reduxjs/toolkit)
 *
 * NOTE: Actions are NOT provided by this package.
 * Actions are handwritten functions in screensets that emit events.
 * This maintains knowledge separation: components know actions, not events.
