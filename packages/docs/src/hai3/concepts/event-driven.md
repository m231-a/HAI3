# Event-Driven Architecture

::: warning Work in Progress
This section is under development. Content will be added in future updates.

## Overview

HAI3 uses event-driven architecture for all cross-domain communication. Components communicate through events rather than direct calls, reducing coupling.

## The Event Bus

TODO: Document event bus API and patterns

## Event Types and Naming

TODO: Document event naming conventions (`domain.entity.action`)

## Emitting Events

TODO: Document how to emit events

## Listening to Events

TODO: Document how to subscribe to events

## Typed Events

TODO: Document TypeScript event typing with `EventPayloadMap`

## Best Practices

TODO: Document event-driven best practices
