# Task Breakdown

::: warning Work in Progress
This section is under development. Content will be added in future updates.

## Overview

Task breakdown decomposes large features into small, implementable tasks that can be estimated and assigned.

## Breakdown Principles

### Vertical Slicing
TODO: Document creating end-to-end slices

### Horizontal Slicing
TODO: Document layer-by-layer breakdown

### INVEST Criteria
TODO: Document Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable

## Task Sizing

TODO: Document appropriate task size (typically 1-3 days)

## Dependency Mapping

TODO: Document identifying and managing task dependencies

## AI-Assisted Breakdown

AI excels at task breakdown:
- Analyzing specifications and identifying subtasks
- Suggesting logical task sequences
- Identifying dependencies automatically
- Proposing task sizes based on complexity

TODO: Add detailed examples and techniques
