# Tactical Layer

**Audience:** Product Managers, Tech Leads, Senior Engineers
**Focus:** Planning and execution

## Overview

The Tactical Layer translates strategic vision and organizational structure into concrete, actionable plans. This is where features become specifications, and roadmaps become sprint plans.

## Responsibilities

- Write detailed feature specifications
- Create team contracts and API agreements
- Plan sprints and iterations
- Break down features into implementable tasks
- Estimate effort and manage capacity

## Key Activities

### 📝 [Specifications](./specifications)
Writing clear, complete specifications for features and changes.

### 🤝 [Team Contracts](./contracts)
Defining interfaces and agreements between teams or components.

### 📅 [Planning](./planning)
Sprint planning, iteration planning, and estimation techniques.

### ✂️ [Task Breakdown](./task-breakdown)
Decomposing features into implementable, sized tasks.

## Deliverables

From the Tactical Layer, you produce:

- **Feature Specifications**: Detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, edge cases
- **Team Contracts**: API contracts, data schemas, interface definitions
- **Sprint Plans**: Prioritized backlog with capacity allocation
- **Task Breakdown**: Granular tasks with size estimates and dependencies

## Interface with Other Layers

**Consumes from Organizational Layer:**
- Team capacity and velocity
- Role assignments
- Collaboration processes
- Decision-making authority

**Produces for Technical Layer:**
- Implementation specifications
- Acceptance criteria
- Task priorities
- Definition of done

## AI Integration

AI excels at tactical work:
- Generating specifications from vision documents
- Identifying edge cases and requirements gaps
- Breaking down features into tasks
- Estimating task complexity
- Suggesting test scenarios

However, AI should **not** make final decisions on:
- Feature scope changes
- Priority adjustments
- Resource allocation
- Definition of done

These require human judgment and stakeholder alignment.

## Planning Methodologies

### Agile/Scrum
- 2-week sprints with planning ceremonies
- Story points for estimation
- Velocity tracking for capacity planning

### Kanban
- Continuous flow with WIP limits
- Lead time and cycle time metrics
- Pull-based task selection

### Shape Up
- 6-week cycles with cooldown periods
- Appetite-based scoping
- Pitch documents instead of backlogs

Choose the methodology that fits your team's workflow and organizational constraints.

## Next Steps

- [Specifications](./specifications) - Learn to write effective specs
- [Team Contracts](./contracts) - Define clear interfaces
- [Planning](./planning) - Master planning methodologies
- [Task Breakdown](./task-breakdown) - Break down work effectively
