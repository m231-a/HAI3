# Organizational Layer

**Audience:** Team Leads, Engineering Managers, Product Managers
**Focus:** Team structure and collaboration

## Overview

The Organizational Layer defines how teams are structured and how they collaborate. This layer ensures clear roles, responsibilities, and interfaces between team members and AI agents.

## Responsibilities

- Define team structure and roles
- Establish separation of duties
- Create collaboration workflows
- Define communication patterns
- Integrate AI agents into team processes

## Key Activities

### 👥 [Team Roles](./team-roles)
Defining roles like Product Manager, Designer, Engineer, and AI Agent with clear responsibilities.

### 🔒 [Separation of Duties](./separation-of-duties)
Establishing boundaries and handoff processes between roles.

### 🤝 [Collaboration Model](./collaboration-model)
Creating effective communication patterns and team workflows.

## Deliverables

From the Organizational Layer, you produce:

- **Team Structure Document**: Org chart with roles and reporting lines
- **Role Definitions**: Clear descriptions of each role's responsibilities
- **Collaboration Workflows**: Processes for team communication and handoffs
- **Interface Contracts**: How different roles interact and exchange information

## Interface with Other Layers

**Consumes from Strategic Layer:**
- Product vision and strategy
- Feature priorities
- Resource allocation guidance

**Produces for Tactical Layer:**
- Team capacity and velocity
- Role assignments
- Collaboration processes
- Decision-making authority

## AI Integration

AI agents operate as team members with:
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Clear interfaces with human team members
- Specific deliverables and quality gates
- Escalation paths for ambiguous situations

## Team Patterns

### Small Team (1-3 developers)
- Individual contributors wear multiple hats
- Informal communication
- AI assists with documentation and boilerplate

### Medium Team (4-10 developers)
- Specialized roles emerge
- Defined processes and handoffs
- AI handles routine tasks and code generation

### Large Team (10+ developers)
- Formal structure with team leads
- Documented processes and gates
- AI integrated into workflows at all levels

## Next Steps

- [Team Roles](./team-roles) - Define your team structure
- [Separation of Duties](./separation-of-duties) - Establish clear boundaries
- [Collaboration Model](./collaboration-model) - Create effective workflows
