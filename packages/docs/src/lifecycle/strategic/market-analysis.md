# Market Analysis

Market analysis identifies opportunities by understanding competitors, market trends, and customer needs. It informs product vision and strategic decisions.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Understand the competitive landscape and identify opportunities
**Audience:** Product managers, executives, strategy teams

## Competitive Analysis

### SWOT Analysis

Analyze each major competitor:

**Strengths:** What they do well
**Weaknesses:** Where they fall short
**Opportunities:** Market gaps they haven't filled
**Threats:** How they could disrupt us

**Example:**
```
Competitor A (Market Leader):
Strengths: Strong brand, large user base, comprehensive features
Weaknesses: Complex UI, slow to innovate, expensive
Opportunities: Target their frustrated enterprise users
Threats: Could add AI features before us
```

### Feature Comparison Matrix

|---------|----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Basic Features | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| AI Integration | ✓ | ✗ | △ | ✗ |
| API Access | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Self-Service | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Price Point | $$ | $$$$ | $ | $$$ |

**Legend:** ✓ = Full support, △ = Partial, ✗ = Not available

### Positioning Map

Plot competitors on key dimensions:

```

## Market Research

### Customer Interviews

**Structure:**
1. Current solution and pain points
2. Ideal solution description
3. Willingness to pay
4. Decision-making process

**Sample questions:**
- "What tools do you currently use for [problem]?"
- "What frustrates you most about [current solution]?"
- "If you could design the perfect solution, what would it include?"
- "What would make you switch from your current solution?"

### Surveys

**Distribution:** Email lists, social media, user communities
**Length:** 5-10 minutes
**Incentive:** Gift card, early access, feature vote

**Key metrics:**
- Problem severity (1-5 scale)
- Current solution satisfaction
- Feature importance ranking
- Price sensitivity

### Usage Data Analysis

If you have existing users:
- Which features are used most/least?
- Where do users drop off?
- What correlates with retention?
- What drives upgrades?

## Opportunity Identification

### Gap Analysis

**Process:**
1. List all customer needs (from research)
2. Map current solutions (yours + competitors)
3. Identify unmet needs
4. Assess market size for each gap

**Example findings:**
- "SMBs need simpler onboarding" → 500K potential users
- "Enterprises need SSO integration" → $2M ARR opportunity
- "Developers need API webhooks" → High engagement driver

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

What "job" are customers hiring your product to do?

**Template:**
"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

**Examples:**
- "When launching a new feature, I want to communicate with users, so I can drive adoption"
- "When analyzing usage data, I want to identify patterns, so I can improve the product"
