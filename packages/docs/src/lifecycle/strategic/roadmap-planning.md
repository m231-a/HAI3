## Overview

A product roadmap communicates your product strategy and timeline to stakeholders, translating vision and priorities into a timeline.

## Roadmap Types

### Strategic Roadmap
TODO: Document high-level, long-term roadmaps

### Release Roadmap
TODO: Document feature-based release planning

### Technology Roadmap
TODO: Document technical infrastructure planning

### Theme-Based Roadmap
TODO: Document theme-based roadmap approaches

## Key Elements

- Timeframes (quarters, months, releases)
- Themes and initiatives
- Major features and milestones
- Dependencies and constraints
- Resource allocation
- Risk factors

## Roadmap Formats

TODO: Document different roadmap visualization formats (Gantt, timeline, swimlane, etc.)

## Deliverables

From roadmap planning, you produce:
- Visual roadmap (timeline, Gantt chart, etc.)
- Milestone definitions
- Release schedule
- Stakeholder communication materials

## AI Integration

AI can assist with roadmap planning by:
- Generating draft roadmaps from feature lists
- Identifying dependencies automatically
- Suggesting realistic timelines based on historical data
- Creating visual roadmap representations
- Updating roadmaps based on progress

## Best Practices

- Keep roadmaps flexible and adjust based on learning
- Focus on outcomes, not just features
- Communicate clearly with all stakeholders
- Review and update regularly
- Balance short-term and long-term planning
