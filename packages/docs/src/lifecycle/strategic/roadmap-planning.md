# Roadmap Planning

## Overview

A roadmap translates strategy into a timeline, communicating plans to stakeholders while maintaining flexibility.

**Purpose:** Show what you're building and when
**Audience:** Internal team + external stakeholders
**Format:** Visual timeline with themes/milestones

## Roadmap Types

### Strategic Roadmap (Now/Next/Later)

**Timeframe:** 6-18 months
**Detail level:** Themes and goals

```
Now (Q1-Q2):
- Theme: Core Functionality
- Goal: Launch MVP to first 100 customers

Next (Q3-Q4):
- Theme: Scale & Polish
- Goal: Reach 1000 users, improve retention

Later (2025):
- Theme: Enterprise Features
- Goal: Land first enterprise customers
```

### Release Roadmap

**Timeframe:** 3-6 months
**Detail level:** Specific features

```
Release 1.0 (March):
- User authentication
- Basic dashboard
- Data import

Release 1.1 (April):
- Advanced filtering

- API access

Release 2.0 (June):
- AI recommendations
- Team collaboration
- Analytics dashboard
```

### Theme-Based Roadmap

**Focus:** Outcomes over features

```
Q1: Get to Product-Market Fit
- Validate core value prop

- Achieve 40% weekly retention

Q2: Scale User Acquisition
- Optimize onboarding
- Add viral features
- Build referral program

Q3: Monetization
- Launch paid tiers
- Add enterprise features
- Improve conversion rate
```

## Key Elements

**Timeframes:**
- Quarters (strategic)
- Months (tactical)
- Sprints (execution)

**Content:**
- Themes (why we're building)
- Features (what we're building)
- Milestones (key achievements)
- Dependencies (what blocks what)

**Metadata:**
- Confidence level
- Resource needs
- Risk factors
- Success metrics

## Roadmap Formats

## Building a Roadmap

**Step 1: Start with Strategy**
Reference: Vision, priorities, resources

**Step 2: Group into Themes**
Organize features around outcomes

**Step 3: Estimate Timing**
Use historical velocity + dependencies

**Step 4: Add Milestones**
Mark key achievements and decision points

**Step 5: Validate**
Check: Realistic? Aligned? Valuable?

**Step 6: Communicate**
Present to stakeholders, gather feedback

## AI Integration

**AI can:**
- Generate draft roadmaps from feature lists
- Identify dependencies automatically
- Estimate timelines from historical data
- Create visual representations
- Suggest theme groupings

**Example prompt:**
"Given these prioritized features [list], team velocity of 30 story points/sprint, and these dependencies [list], create a 6-month release roadmap with quarterly themes."

## Best Practices

**Be Flexible:**
- Update quarterly
- Expect 30-50% change
- Timeframes are estimates

**Focus on Outcomes:**
- Themes > Features
- Goals > Deliverables
- "Why" > "What"

**Communicate Clearly:**
- Different views for different audiences
- Executives: Themes + outcomes
- Team: Features + timeline
- Customers: Value + benefits

**Manage Expectations:**
- Show confidence levels
- Mark tentative items
- Explain what's not on roadmap

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too detailed too far out**
✅ Detail decreases with time

❌ **Commit to dates publicly**
✅ Show ranges or confidence levels

❌ **Feature list, not strategy**
✅ Organize around themes/outcomes

❌ **Never update**
✅ Review and revise regularly

## Deliverables

- **Visual Roadmap** (timeline format)
- **Detailed Feature List** (with estimates)
- **Milestone Definitions** (success criteria)
- **Communication Plan** (how to share updates)
