# Vision Definition

## Overview

A product vision articulates the long-term goal and value proposition. It aligns teams and guides decisions.

**Purpose:** Define what you're building and why
**Audience:** All stakeholders (team, executives, investors)
**Format:** 1-2 paragraph vision statement + supporting materials

## Key Components

### Problem Statement

**What problem exists?**

Template: "Today, [target users] struggle with [problem] which causes [impact]."

Example: "Today, product teams struggle with prioritizing features across multiple stakeholders, which causes delays, misalignment, and wasted effort building the wrong things."

### Target Audience

**Who experiences this problem?**

Define:
- Demographics (role, company size, industry)
- Psychographics (goals, frustrations, behaviors)
- Buying patterns (budget, decision process)

Example Persona:
```
Name: Sarah (Product Manager)
Company: Series B SaaS startup (50-200 employees)
Goals: Ship features faster, reduce stakeholder conflicts
Frustrations: Too many opinions, no data-driven prioritization
Budget Authority: Influences $10K-50K decisions
```

### Value Proposition

**How do we solve it uniquely?**

Template: "For [target users] who [need], our product is a [category] that [benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], we [differentiator]."

Example: "For product managers who need to prioritize features objectively, our product is a prioritization platform that uses data-driven scoring to eliminate guesswork. Unlike spreadsheets and generic tools, we integrate with your existing tools and provide AI-powered insights."

### Success Metrics

**How do we measure success?**

Define:
- Usage metrics (DAU, MAU, engagement)
- Business metrics (revenue, retention, NPS)
- Impact metrics (time saved, efficiency gained)

Example:
- 10,000 active product managers by Year 2
- $5M ARR by Year 2
- 40% reduction in time spent prioritizing (user survey)
- NPS > 50

## Vision Statement

### Template

"We envision a world where [future state]. We're building [product] to [purpose] by [approach]."

### Examples

**Slack:**
"We envision a world where work flows effortlessly. We're building a collaboration platform to make working life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive by bringing all communication into one place."

**Airbnb:**
"We envision a world where anyone can belong anywhere. We're building a platform to connect travelers with unique local experiences by empowering hosts to share their spaces and cities."

**Your Product:**
"We envision a world where product decisions are driven by data, not politics. We're building a prioritization platform to help teams build what matters by combining user research, business metrics, and AI insights into a single source of truth."

## Crafting Your Vision

**Step 1: Draft**
Write rough version covering: problem, solution, impact

**Step 2: Refine**
- Make it inspiring but realistic
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Keep it concise (1-2 paragraphs)
- Make it memorable

**Step 3: Validate**
- Share with team and stakeholders
- Does it inspire?
- Is it clear?
- Does it guide decisions?

**Step 4: Socialize**
- Present at all-hands
- Add to onboarding docs
- Reference in decision-making

## AI Integration

**AI can:**
- Generate draft vision statements from problem descriptions
- Analyze competitor visions for patterns
- Suggest value propositions from market data
- Refine language for clarity and impact

**Example prompt:**
"Based on these customer pain points [list], our competitive advantages [list], and target market [description], draft 3 product vision statements following this template: [template]."
