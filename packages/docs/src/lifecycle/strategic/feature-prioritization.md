Feature prioritization helps you decide what to build first based on business value, effort, and strategic alignment.

## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Framework

### MoSCoW Method
TODO: Document MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)

### Value vs. Effort Matrix
TODO: Document value vs. effort scoring

### Kano Model
TODO: Document Kano model for feature prioritization

### Opportunity Scoring
TODO: Document opportunity scoring techniques

## Key Considerations

- Business value and revenue impact
- User needs and pain points
- Technical complexity and dependencies
- Time to market
- Strategic alignment
- Competitive pressure

## Deliverables

From feature prioritization, you produce:
- Prioritized feature list with scores
- Prioritization rationale document
- Trade-off analysis
- Roadmap input

## AI Integration

AI can assist with prioritization by:
- Scoring features based on defined criteria
- Identifying dependencies between features
- Analyzing historical data for effort estimates
- Suggesting priority adjustments based on market trends
