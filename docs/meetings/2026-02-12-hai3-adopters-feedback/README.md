## 🎯 Meeting Goals (ACHIEVED)

1. ✅ **Gather Real-World Feedback:** Analytics and CyberApp teams shared experiences

3. ✅ **Prioritize Roadmap:** Stability, docs, and success rate improvements prioritized
4. ✅ **Quick Wins:** 4 quick wins identified (1-2 week delivery)
5. ✅ **Documentation Needs:** Critical gaps documented (screen sets, migration, architecture)

---

## Key Findings

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Internationalization** - Universally praised, works perfectly
2. **Validation tooling** - Ensures architectural compliance
3. **Core concept** - Teams believe in the vision
4. **Proof of concept** - Both projects work in production

### ❌ Critical Blockers (P0)
1. **Chaotic Development** - Daily breaking changes, no stable roadmap
2. **Low Success Rate** - Only 40% of AI-generated code works initially
3. **Documentation Gaps** - Unclear when/how to use features
4. **Context Overload** - Too many rules confuse AI

### 🎯 Top 3 Priorities
1. **Stabilize Roadmap** - Publish milestones, freeze breaking changes (2-4 weeks)
2. **Critical Documentation** - Screen sets guide, migration guide, architecture docs
3. **Improve Success Rate** - Audit rules, fix API restrictions, simplify context
