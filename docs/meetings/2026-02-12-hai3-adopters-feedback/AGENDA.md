## Agenda

### 1. Opening & Context (3 minutes)
**Facilitator:** [Name]

- Welcome and meeting purpose
- Current state: v0.1.0 (~70% complete, early preview)

### 2. Team Member Lightning Talks (20 minutes total)

**Format:** Each person speaks for ~5 minutes maximum

#### Standard Questions for Each Speaker:
1. **What is it?** - Briefly describe the HAI3 aspect you've worked with
2. **Why we use/will use it** - The problem it solves or value it provides
3. **What you like** - Strengths, pleasant surprises, "aha moments"
4. **What you dislike** - Pain points, friction, missing features

#### Speaker Rotation:

**Speaker 1: Architecture & Packages (5 min)**
- 4-layer architecture (SDK → Framework → React → App)
- Package structure and dependencies
- Layer separation enforcement
- Import rules and conventions

**Speaker 2: Screen Development Workflow (5 min)**
- Creating/managing screensets
- Draft → Mockup → Production pipeline
- AI-assisted screen generation experience
- Screenset switching and management

**Speaker 3: Developer Experience & Tooling (5 min)**
- HAI3 CLI usage (create, screenset, update commands)
- AI guidelines (.ai/GUIDELINES.md and targets)
- IDE integration and development workflow
- Build/dev/lint commands

**Speaker 4: Event-Driven Architecture & State (5 min)**
- EventBus and state management
- Redux slice registration
- Cross-screenset communication patterns
- Event naming conventions

**Speaker 5: Styling, Components & UI Kit (5 min)** *(Optional - combine with Speaker 3 if fewer participants)*
- UI Kit usage and component library
- Theme system and customization
- Tailwind CSS integration and constraints
- Style consistency enforcement

### 3. Group Discussion: Critical Issues (5 minutes)

**Priority Questions:**
1. **Biggest Blocker:** What's the #1 thing preventing smooth development?
2. **Documentation Gap:** Where did you get stuck due to unclear/missing docs?
3. **Tooling Pain:** What manual work should be automated?
4. **AI Workflow:** Is the Draft → Mockup → Production flow practical or theoretical?

### 4. Quick Wins & Roadmap Priorities (2 minutes)

- Identify 2-3 immediate improvements the team needs
- Vote on which pending features matter most
- Assign follow-up action owners

---

## Expected Outcomes

By end of meeting, we should have:

1. ✅ **Top 3 Blockers** - Issues preventing productive development
2. ✅ **Quick Wins** - 2-3 improvements deliverable in 1-2 weeks
3. ✅ **Roadmap Adjustments** - Which features to prioritize/deprioritize
4. ✅ **Documentation Needs** - Critical missing docs to write
5. ✅ **Follow-up Actions** - Who owns what next steps

---

## Meeting Ground Rules

- **Timeboxing:** Hard 5-minute limit per speaker
- **Honest Feedback:** No judgment, all perspectives valued
- **Focus on Practical:** Share real experiences, not theoretical concerns
- **Parking Lot:** Table deep technical discussions for later
- **Action-Oriented:** Every concern should have a potential next step

## Post-Meeting Actions

1. **Document Feedback** - Consolidate notes into GitHub Issues (Owner: [Name])
2. **Update Roadmap** - Adjust priorities based on team input (Owner: [Name])
3. **Create Tickets** - Break blockers into actionable tasks (Owner: [Name])
4. **Schedule Follow-up** - Plan next sync in 2-4 weeks (Owner: [Name])
