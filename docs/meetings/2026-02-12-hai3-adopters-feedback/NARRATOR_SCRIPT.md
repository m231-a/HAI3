---

## PRE-MEETING (5 minutes before start)

### Welcome & Tech Check

> "Good [morning/afternoon] everyone! Let's do a quick tech check before we start. Can everyone hear me okay? If you can, please give a thumbs up or unmute and say yes."

*Wait for responses*

> "Perfect. Just a reminder - we'll be recording this session for note-taking purposes only. The recording won't be shared externally. If anyone has concerns about recording, please let me know now."

*Pause for concerns*

> "Great. We'll be starting in about [X] minutes. In the meantime, please make sure you have your prep notes handy - especially the specific examples you wanted to share."

---

## OPENING (Slide 1-2) - 3 minutes

### Introduction

> "Alright, let's get started. Thank you all for joining today's HAI3 Adopters Feedback Session. My name is [Your Name] and I'll be facilitating this 30-minute meeting."

> "The purpose of this session is simple: you've been using HAI3 in practice, and we need to hear about your real-world experience. What's working? What's not? What's blocking you? Your honest feedback will directly shape our roadmap and priorities."

### Ground Rules

> "A few ground rules before we dive in:"

> "First, we're timeboxing strictly. Each speaker has exactly 5 minutes. I'll give you a 1-minute warning, and at 5 minutes, we need to move on. If you have more to share, we'll capture it in the parking lot."

> "Second, this is a no-judgment zone. We want honest feedback - both positive and negative. If something frustrated you, we want to hear about it. If something delighted you, we also want to hear about that."

> "Third, let's stay practical. Share your actual experiences, not theoretical concerns. Concrete examples are gold."

> "Fourth, deep technical discussions go to the parking lot. We'll note them and handle them separately."

> "Everyone comfortable with that format?"

*Wait for acknowledgment*

---

## CONTEXT (Slide 3) - 1 minute

### Current State

> "Quick context on where we are: HAI3 is currently at version 0.1.0, which is an early preview. We're about 70% complete with the initial release."

> "What IS complete: The 4-layer SDK architecture is solid. All 11 core packages are published and working. The CLI tooling is functional. The event-driven architecture is in place. And we have AI guidelines with custom ESLint rules."

> "What's NOT complete: Role-based access control is still in progress. Testing infrastructure is limited. Electron builds aren't ready yet. And documentation has gaps."

> "So you've been working with an early preview version. That means your feedback is especially valuable because you're helping us shape the direction before we lock things in."

---

## LIGHTNING TALKS INTRODUCTION (Slide 4-6) - 1 minute

### Format Overview

> "Now let's move to the main event: lightning talks from five team members."

> "Each speaker will have 5 minutes to answer four standard questions:"

> "One: WHAT IS IT? Briefly describe the HAI3 aspect you worked with."

> "Two: WHY DO WE USE IT? What problem does it solve or what value does it provide?"

> "Three: WHAT DO YOU LIKE? Share specific strengths, pleasant surprises, or 'aha moments'."

> "Four: WHAT DO YOU DISLIKE? Share specific pain points, friction, or missing features."

> "Speakers, please use concrete examples from your actual work. The more specific you are, the more actionable your feedback is."

> "I'll be monitoring time closely. When you hit 4 minutes, I'll give a 1-minute warning. At 5 minutes sharp, we need to move to the next speaker."

> "Any questions before we begin?"

*Pause briefly*

## PARKING LOT MANAGEMENT

### When to Use Parking Lot

Use these phrases to redirect when:
- Speaker goes over time
- Discussion gets too detailed
- Technical debate starts
- Question requires long answer

#### Phrases:

> "That's a great point, but let's add it to the parking lot so we can stay on schedule."

> "This sounds like it needs a deeper discussion. Let's note it in the parking lot and schedule time to dig into it properly."

> "I'm capturing this in the parking lot. We'll make sure to follow up on it after the meeting."

> "Important topic, but we need to keep moving. Parking lot for now, and we'll circle back."

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Speaker Won't Stop at 5 Minutes

> "I apologize for interrupting [Name], but we need to stay on schedule. Can you give us one final sentence to wrap up?"

### If Discussion Gets Heated

> "I hear strong opinions on both sides. Let's capture this in the parking lot and discuss it with a clearer head after the meeting."

### If Meeting Runs Over

> "We're at time, but this is clearly an important discussion. Can we schedule a 15-minute follow-up for tomorrow to continue?"

### If No One Speaks Up

> "Let me call on a few people directly. [Name 1], what's your take? [Name 2], what about you?"

### If Too Many Topics in Parking Lot

> "We have a lot in the parking lot, which tells me we need more time. Let's prioritize the top 3 items from the parking lot and schedule dedicated sessions for those."
