# Design: Automatic NPM Publishing on PR Merge

## Context

### Current State

- HAI3 monorepo with 9 packages in `packages/` directory
- Manual publishing workflow documented but not automated
- Existing CI workflow (`main.yml`) runs validation and generates dependency graph
- Most packages have `publishConfig: { "access": "public" }` configured (requires verification)
- Packages follow layered architecture with clear dependency order

### Package Inventory

| Package | Layer | Dependencies | Current Version |
|---------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| `@hai3/state` | L1 (SDK) | None | 0.2.0-alpha.0 |
| `@hai3/screensets` | L1 (SDK) | None | 0.2.0-alpha.0 |
| `@hai3/api` | L1 (SDK) | None | 0.2.0-alpha.0 |
| `@hai3/i18n` | L1 (SDK) | None | 0.2.0-alpha.0 |
| `@hai3/framework` | L2 | L1 packages | 0.2.0-alpha.1 |
| `@hai3/react` | L3 | @hai3/framework | 0.2.0-alpha.1 |
| `@hai3/uikit` | L4 (UI) | None (standalone) | 0.2.0-alpha.1 |
| `@hai3/studio` | L5 (Tools) | @hai3/react | 0.2.0-alpha.0 |
| `@hai3/cli` | L6 (CLI) | All (templates) | 0.2.0-alpha.8 |

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals

- Automate package publishing upon PR merge to main
- Ensure correct dependency-order publishing
- Prevent duplicate version conflicts with NPM registry
- Provide clear logging for debugging and auditing
- Integrate with existing CI infrastructure

### Non-Goals

- Version bump automation (developer responsibility)
- Changelog generation (separate tooling)
- Multi-registry publishing (NPM only)
- Canary/nightly releases (only on version bump)

## Decision: GitHub Actions Workflow with Sequential Publishing

### Approach

Create a new GitHub Actions workflow that:
1. Triggers on PR merge to main
2. Detects package version changes via git diff
3. Checks NPM registry for version existence
4. Builds packages in dependency order
5. Publishes each changed package sequentially

### Rationale

- **Sequential publishing**: Ensures dependency resolution; if L2 package publishes before L1, npm install would fail
- **Version diff detection**: Simple, reliable, no external tooling required
- **NPM registry check**: Idempotent behavior, safe to re-run
- **Single workflow file**: Easy to maintain and debug

### Alternatives Considered

#### Option A: Use Changesets

```yaml
# Would add changesets as dev dependency
# Requires contributors to create changeset files
```

- **Pros**: Industry standard, handles versioning + changelogs
- **Cons**: Additional contributor overhead, learning curve, overkill for current needs
- **Verdict**: Consider for future when team grows; too heavy for current workflow

#### Option B: Use Lerna

```yaml
# Lerna publish from-git
```

- **Pros**: Monorepo-native, handles ordering automatically
- **Cons**: Heavy dependency, deprecated in favor of Nx/Turborepo patterns
- **Verdict**: Rejected - unnecessary complexity

#### Option C: Custom Script (Chosen)

- **Pros**: Full control, minimal dependencies, matches HAI3 simplicity principles
- **Cons**: Requires maintenance, testing
- **Verdict**: Best fit for current project size and needs

## Technical Design

### Workflow File Structure

```
.github/
  workflows/
    main.yml              # Existing CI workflow
    publish-packages.yml  # New publish workflow (this proposal)
```

### Trigger Configuration

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    branches: [main]
```

The workflow uses `pull_request.closed` with a condition check for `merged == true`. This is more reliable than `push` for tracking PR merges.

### Version Detection Logic

The workflow uses GitHub's PR event data to reliably detect version changes across ALL merge strategies:

```bash
# Use the PR's base commit SHA from GitHub event data
# This is the commit that main pointed to BEFORE the PR was merged
BASE_COMMIT="${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}"

# Get changed files between merge commit and base
git diff "$BASE_COMMIT" --name-only | grep 'packages/.*/package.json'

# For each changed package.json, extract version diff
git diff "$BASE_COMMIT" -- packages/state/package.json | grep '"version"'
```

**Why `github.event.pull_request.base.sha` instead of `HEAD~1`:**

| Merge Strategy | HEAD~1 | base.sha |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| Standard merge | Previous main tip (correct) | Previous main tip (correct) |
| Squash merge | Previous main tip (correct) | Previous main tip (correct) |
| Rebase and merge | Second-to-last PR commit (WRONG) | Previous main tip (correct) |

With "rebase and merge", all PR commits are replayed onto main. `HEAD~1` would be the second-to-last replayed commit, missing version changes in earlier PR commits. Using `base.sha` gives the true previous main tip regardless of merge strategy.

**Note**: Using `fetch-depth: 0` ensures full git history is available for accurate diff comparison against the base commit.

### NPM Registry Check

```bash
# Returns exit code 0 if version exists, non-zero if not found
npm view @hai3/state@0.2.0-alpha.1 version 2>/dev/null

# Check logic:
# - If version exists: skip publishing
# - If version not found: proceed with publish
```

### Publishing Order Implementation

The workflow defines explicit publishing phases:

```yaml
jobs:
  detect-changes:
    # Outputs: changed_packages (JSON array of package names with version changes)

  publish-sdk:
    # Publishes: @hai3/state, @hai3/screensets, @hai3/api, @hai3/i18n
    # Parallel within layer (no inter-dependencies)
    needs: [detect-changes]

  publish-framework:
    # Publishes: @hai3/framework
    needs: [publish-sdk]

  publish-react:
    # Publishes: @hai3/react
    needs: [publish-framework]

  publish-ui:
    # Publishes: @hai3/uikit
    # Can run parallel with SDK (no dependencies)
    needs: [detect-changes]

  publish-studio:
    # Publishes: @hai3/studio
    needs: [publish-react]

  publish-cli:
    # Publishes: @hai3/cli
    # Always last
    needs: [publish-sdk, publish-framework, publish-react, publish-ui, publish-studio]
```

## Security Considerations

### NPM Token Management

- Token stored as GitHub Actions secret `NPM_TOKEN`
- Organization-level automation token recommended (bypasses 2FA)
- Token should have minimal scope: publish only, no read private
- Regular rotation recommended (annually)

### Workflow Permissions

The workflow uses minimal permissions at the workflow level for security best practice:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read  # Required for checkout and git operations
```

**Note**: `packages: write` would be added only if publishing to GitHub Packages in addition to NPM.

### Branch Protection

- Main branch should require PR reviews
- Only merged PRs trigger publish (not direct pushes)
- CI must pass before merge (existing `main.yml` workflow)

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Partial Publish Failure

- **Impact**: Some packages published, some not; version inconsistency
- **Mitigation**: Fail-fast behavior prevents further publishes
- **Recovery**: Fix issue, create new PR with version bump for failed packages

### Risk: NPM Outage During Publish

- **Impact**: Workflow fails mid-publish
- **Mitigation**:
  - Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 5s, 10s, 20s delays)
  - NPM check before each publish ensures idempotent behavior on re-run
- **Recovery**: If all retries fail, wait for NPM recovery and re-run workflow

### Risk: Build Divergence

- **Impact**: Published package differs from source
- **Mitigation**: Fresh checkout, clean build in workflow
- **Recovery**: Publish new version with correct build

### Trade-off: Sequential vs Parallel Publishing

- **Sequential**: Slower but guarantees dependency order
- **Parallel**: Faster but risks dependency resolution failures
- **Decision**: Sequential for reliability; total time is acceptable (~3-5 min for all packages)

## Testing Strategy

### Local Testing

1. Run version detection script manually
2. Verify NPM check logic with existing/non-existing versions
3. Test build order with `npm run build:packages`

### Staging Testing

1. Create test packages with `-test` suffix
2. Publish to NPM with test versions
3. Verify all workflow steps

### Production Validation

1. First real publish: single package with minor version bump
2. Monitor NPM for correct publication
3. Verify package works when installed

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Workflow Logs

- Each step outputs clear status messages
- Package list shown before publishing
- Success/skip/fail status for each package

### GitHub Actions Summary

- Summary job creates markdown summary
- Visible on PR merge and Actions tab
- Lists all published packages or failure status

### Rollback Procedure

NPM does not support true rollback, but:
1. Deprecate bad version: `npm deprecate @hai3/pkg@version "Broken, use X instead"`
2. Publish fixed version with incremented version number
3. Update dependents to use fixed version

## Open Questions

1. **Should we add Slack/Discord notifications?**
   - Currently: No, keep minimal
   - Future: Add when team grows, as separate PR

2. **Should we add NPM provenance?**
   - Currently: No, requires additional setup
   - Future: Yes, for supply chain security (GitHub Actions supports this)

3. **Should UI package (`@hai3/uikit`) publish in parallel with SDK?**
   - Currently: Yes, it has no @hai3 dependencies
   - Note: This is safe and speeds up overall publish time
